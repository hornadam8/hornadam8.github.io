When I was a sophomore in college (about 3 years ago),  I took a philosophy class titled "Logic" which introduced me to the use of formal logic and logical operators to condense information and evaluate the validity of claims. I was absolutely obsessed with it immediately. I remember completing the homework before leaving class everytime the class met because, once the concept was explained, I had no issue applying it to any problem that might be contained in the homework. What was more, I actually enjoyed it. Later, as a senior, I was introduced to front-end programming languages like CSS and HTML. I slowly realized that coding was a form practical application of logic and math that was purely devoted to the form of problem-solving and applied knowledge I had come to love as a sophomore. I completed my journalism degree but knew I was neither going to become a journalist nor go to law school(as was my plan for a time), I wanted to code.
