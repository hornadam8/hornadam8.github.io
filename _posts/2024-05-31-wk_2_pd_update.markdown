This week I primarily focused on my goal of getting better at leetcode questions since I have a final interview loop friday/monday. I completed 15 problems from the interview top 150 (providing multiple solutions for most of them), 
of easy and medium difficulty. Next week I'll get started in earnest on my CLI wrapper tool, but this week I needed to get freshened up on interview questions. The list of problems I completed is below

Merge Sorted Array (easy)
Remove Element (easy
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (easy)
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array IIÂ  (medium)
Majority Element (easy)
Rotate Array (medium)
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (easy)

Jump Game (medium)
Jump Game II (medium)
H-Index (medium)
Longest Palindromic Substring (medium)
Roman to Integer (easy)
Length of Last Word (easy)
