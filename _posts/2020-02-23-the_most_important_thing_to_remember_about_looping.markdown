The most important thing to remember about looping is that you must create some mechanism to end the loop. Unlike iteration, looping will continuously perform the operation until a condition is met. Therefore not including a some sort of while/until and counter could result in an infinite loop. Basically the most important thing to remember about looping is that it isnt a form of iteration, plain and simple.
