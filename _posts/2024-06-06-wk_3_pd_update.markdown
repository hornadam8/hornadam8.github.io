Over the last week, I had 3 interviews (hopefully I'll be hearing back tomorrow and I'll post some take-aways). I also wrote out and submitted my project proposal, and went to create my website before realizing I had already made one while I was in 
bootcamp in 2020, so did a bit of clean up there and will be aiming to move my posts over to it between today and tomorrow.
