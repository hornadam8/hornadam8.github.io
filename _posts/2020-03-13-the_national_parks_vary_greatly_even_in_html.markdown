When I saw the requirements for the CLI datagem project, I immediately decided I wanted to write a program that collected information on the national parks and gave it to the user as an easy to use, self-explanatory and visually pleasing(as much so as a CLI can be anyway) guide to all the national parks. This program would be complete with information on where the park is located, a brief description and longer informational section for each park, as well as specific options to see information on weather, wildlife and camping in the park. 

I could go into any number of issues that I encountered building this gem but the most challenging part of the project involved scraping locations for 62 pages which were very built differently. The resulting code that solved this issue involved nested conditionals, children to array conversion/counting, and some long nights/early mornings in pry. With that said, it is incredibly rewarding to have managed to do exactly what i set out to do without having to compromise. I knew you probably couldn't bring the same gear to all the national parks, but it turns out you can't bring the same code either.
