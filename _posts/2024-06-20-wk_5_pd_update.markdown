This week, I reflected and wrote about my recent job interview so that hopefully others can gather useful knowledge from my experience. I also spent some time reacquainting myself with my github pages website since its been quite a long time since I used all of its bells and whistles. I'm happy to report that my posts actually show up on my page now! Jekyll is a little odd and ... holy jquery these scripts are a blast from the past ... but I'll work forward with it for now. Once I get fiber internet later this summer, I plan to host a custom rust + htmx/leptos site on a kubernetes cluster on my home server, but for the time being I use starlink and can't serve traffic. I also got a local repo set up for my CLI tool but wasn't able to get much past that. Now that I've eaten my vegetables in getting through this interview and wrangling/grokking outdated JavaScript for my website, I'm hoping to log almost all of my class hours into CLion next week and get some meat on my CLI.
