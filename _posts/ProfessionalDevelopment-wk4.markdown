I made plans to work on my CLI tool this afternoon, but there was a bit of a career-development related interruption to the scheduled programming(pun intended). This morning a director of engineering at the company I'm interviewing with emailed and asked if I was available for a call, obviously I said yes and I met with him and he gave me my offer.

Unfortunately there had been a bit of a miscommunication with the internal recruiter, and the offer was below the range I was expecting (and actually below my current comp all things considered), so I've spent most of the day negotiating salary via email and google meet. About an hour ago they invited me to a 30 minute call and said they had another offer and I could join the call or let them know when I would next be available. Unfortunately I had gone for a walk to destress so I missed it, but we scheduled another meeting for in the morning and I think we're close to finalizing this deal.

If I'm honest, it has been an extremely exhausting day and I would rather have been working on the CLI and plan to make up for lost time this weekend. I also plan to post about my interview experience as soon as its all wrapped up so I'm saving most details for that post.
