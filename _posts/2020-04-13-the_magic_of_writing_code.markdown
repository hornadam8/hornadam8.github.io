I find that at the beginning of learning a new concept, I often tend to lose a little motivation and feel down because, obviously, learning can be hard. The magic that I saught to understand can often only seem more magical when I initially fail to emulate it. The method I can see in my code is showing no method error or the server is running in my terminal but the page won't open. I could go on forever with problems that can make a concept seem more abstract at first attempt than at observation.

It all seems to be going down hill when all the sudden, I see it...

Usually, I notice a mispelled method or variable somewhere and I have to nod at the english teach in my head(usually my mom) wagging their finger and saying "I told you proofreading was important". Other times, I realize I left out a crucial coponent altogether. No matter what the reason was, it wasn't my failure to be admitted to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.

The only truly magical thing about any concept in coding is the moment that you understand that it isn't magic. The moment that a previously mystifying concept works in my code and, even better, *makes sense* to me in a logical way, is an uniquely satisfying experience. At that moment, it feels like I'm a medieval alchemist that just discovered fundamental chemistry and suddenly I'm a scientist and not a sorcerer. If anything about coding is magical, that has to be it.
